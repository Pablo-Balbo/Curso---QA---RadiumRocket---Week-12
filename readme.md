This week in the Radium Rocket QA course, we started working on test case automation.
In the file "exercises.js" are the functions to be tested, all of them exported.
On the other hand, in the file "exercises.test.js" are the same imported functions, together with their respective testing methods.
NodeJs, Jest and Babel were used for this work.
